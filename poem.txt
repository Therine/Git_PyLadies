Stopping by the woods on a snowy evening
by Robert Frost

Whose woods these are
I think I know
his house is in the village though
He will not see me stopping here, 
to watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake
