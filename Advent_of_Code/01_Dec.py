#Cool, looks like integers now!
#prestep, can I even find the difference between 2 of these items in the lines list?

#A really bizarre way to figure this out is to make one more list from these files and just compare each index against each other.

#okey, now I have to Lubo's progress marker thing
#I don't actually need a while loop
